This project uses a simple neural network model to predict the email labels from these 13 classification labels:

- `regulations and regulators (includes price caps)`
- `internal projects -- progress and strategy`
- `company image -- current`
- `company image -- changing / influencing`
- `political influence / contributions / contacts`
- `california energy crisis / california politics`
- `internal company policy`
- `internal company operations`
- `alliances / partnerships`
- `legal advice`
- `talking points`
- `meeting minutes`
- `trip reports`
